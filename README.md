# Take-home coding challenge for frontend interviews at Tradeshift
---
You will need to request an [API key](http://api.bart.gov/api/register.aspx) before starting. The process is fast and automated. If you don't receive the key quickly, check your spam folder.

## Project
---
We would like you to develop an application that displays information about BART stations using the [BART API](https://api.bart.gov).

This application should have the following features
- [ ] Allow a user to select any station in the BART system
- [ ] Display the full name of the selected station
- [ ] Display the routes this station has access to (Pittsburg / Bay point line, Richmond line, etc.)
- [ ] Display whether the station has parking, bike racks, or lockers
- [ ] Show the arriving and departing trains with their respective times to do so at this station
- [ ] Show the route these trains are on
- [ ] Show the number of cars for the arriving / departing trains
- [ ] Indicate which direction these trains are going in
- [ ] Show which platform the train will be arriving on / departing from
- [ ] It should have some meaningful tests

## Things to know
---
We have provided a scaffold from `create-react-app` to get started with. If you would like to use any other framework, please feel free to do so.

We expect you can start the app with `npm start` and run tests with `npm test` (or `yarn`).

Please create a fork of this repo and host the results in your own github account.
